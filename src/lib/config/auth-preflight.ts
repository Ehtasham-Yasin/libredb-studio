/**
 * Boot-time auth-config preflight (issue #227).
 *
 * A `JWT_SECRET` shorter than the minimum used to slip through every startup
 * path: zero-config bootstrap only fills a MISSING secret, nothing validated an
 * explicitly-set one, and `GET /api/db/health` answers "healthy" unconditionally.
 * The deployment looked fine from the outside while every login returned 503 —
 * how the Cosmos servapp shipped broken for three weeks (Cosmos generates
 * 24-character passwords; the template passed one straight to `JWT_SECRET`).
 *
 * Why a hard exit rather than a health-check signal: `/api/db/health` is wired
 * as the Kubernetes **livenessProbe** (charts/libredb-studio/values.yaml) and as
 * the Docker/PaaS health check. Reporting a config error there would restart the
 * pod forever without ever fixing it, and would hide the login screen's
 * actionable 503 behind CrashLoopBackOff. Refusing to boot costs nothing either:
 * with a too-short secret the server can sign no session at all, so no working
 * deployment can regress — there is simply nothing to lose by stopping loudly.
 *
 * The same reasoning covers `STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (backlog K3): too short, it
 * throws only at the first storage write - after login, after the migration
 * attempt - and reaches the operator as a `syncError` badge in someone's browser
 * rather than as a startup failure. It is checked only when a server storage
 * provider is configured, because with STORAGE_PROVIDER=local (the default) the
 * variable is inert and refusing to boot over it would be plainly wrong.
 *
 * Runs only on standalone boot (called from instrumentation.ts `register()`),
 * so embedding @libredb/studio in libredb-platform is unaffected.
