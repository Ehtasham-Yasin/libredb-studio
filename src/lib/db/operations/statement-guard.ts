/**
 * Input-stage statement-shape guard for the agent path (#328).
 *
 * DEFENSE IN DEPTH, NEVER THE BOUNDARY. The boundary is database-native: a
 * PostgreSQL read-only transaction under a least-privilege role, and a SQLite
 * read-only open with `query_only` re-asserted per statement (see the execution
 * profiles in `providers/sql/postgres.ts` / `sqlite.ts`). This guard exists
 * because those controls are scoped to what they protect and because silent
 * truncation is not a refusal: `prepare()` drops the tail of a multi-statement
 * string rather than rejecting it, and an operation that asked to run two
 * statements should be told no, not partly obeyed.
 *
 * Everything here reads the shared SQL readers in `src/lib/sql` rather than
 * matching text. That matters in both directions:
 *
 * - a keyword a statement merely MENTIONS — inside a string, a quoted
 *   identifier, a comment, a dollar-quoted body — is not the statement doing it
 *   (`words.ts` records four defects of exactly that kind), so a legitimate
 *   read like `SELECT 'insert into t' AS note` must stay allowed;
 * - a keyword hidden BEHIND trivia or a CTE list is still the statement doing
 *   it, so `/* SELECT *\/ INSERT …` and `WITH x AS (…) UPDATE …` must be
 *   refused. `readOperativeKeyword` answers the second one by walking the CTE
 *   grammar instead of searching the text.
 *
 * The reading is dialect-less (`DEFAULT_SQL_GRAMMAR`): the descriptor's input
 * contract is evaluated before a provider is chosen. Where the dialects disagree
 * about a run's meaning, the default reading is not automatically the safe one —
 * two forms disagree about where the STATEMENT ENDS, and reading them the
 * default way would admit a second statement rather than refuse a read:
 *
 * - `$tag$…$tag$` is a literal in PostgreSQL and a bind parameter followed by
 *   ordinary code in SQLite, so a `;` written inside one really terminates the
 *   statement there;
 * - `#` opens a comment in MySQL/ClickHouse, is an operator in PostgreSQL and
 *   prefixes a bind variable in SQLite.
 *
 * Both are therefore refused outright (`DIALECT_AMBIGUOUS_TEXT`) instead of
 * being read under one dialect's rules. A third form was considered and left
 * alone: `[…]` is a quoted identifier under this grammar and an array subscript
 * whose contents are CODE in PostgreSQL, so `SELECT a[1 ; DROP TABLE t]` reads
 * as one statement here and as two there. It stays admitted because it is not
 * exploitable on either engine this milestone serves — PostgreSQL takes one
 * command per Parse message and rejects that text outright, and SQLite really
 * does read the run as an identifier.
 *
 * The one direction this layer accepts being wrong is over-refusal, and it costs
 * real queries:
 *
 * - PostgreSQL's jsonb path operators `#>` and `#>>` are refused with everything
 *   else carrying a `#`. Use `->` / `->>` or `jsonb_extract_path()` instead.
 * - a bare non-reserved keyword used as an identifier (`SELECT copy FROM ads`,
 *   `SELECT set FROM t`) is refused; quoting it (`SELECT "set" FROM t`) is the
 *   escape hatch.
 * - a dollar-quoted literal (`SELECT $$x$$`) is refused; ordinary quotes are not.
 *
 * That trade is deliberate — a refused read is re-runnable, a missed write is not.

  // That is refused because of what this path is FOR. Every claim an agent composes

  // about their database. A dirty read passes every citation check there is - the
  // artifact is real, the correlation id resolves - while the number in it is not a fact

  // then ROLLED BACK (`Person.Person` row 1 came back `DIRTYVALUE` where the committed
  // value is `Ken`), and `WITH (READPAST)` answered `count(*) = 2` over three committed
  // rows, short by the locked one and with no error. As with the seven above, the
  // provider's admission step cannot see any of them: a hinted SELECT compiles to ONE
  // root of class `SELECT`, measured.
  //
  // Nothing honest is lost by refusing. The same read without the hint is bounded by the
  // `SET LOCK_TIMEOUT` the profile already issues per statement: measured as error 1222
  // after 1.5s on a database with read-committed snapshot OFF, and where it is ON, as the
  // fixture database is, the read does not wait at all and answered the committed value
  // immediately. An error a model can report and repair is worth more here than a number
  // that is quietly wrong.
