/**
 * Cassandra driver seam guard (issue #424, Phase 4)
 *
 * This provider's seam is a PACKAGE rather than a protocol, which makes the rule
 * simpler than Trino's and the stake different. `cassandra-driver` is the only
 * runtime dependency #424 has added, and the whole reason the provider is worth
 * having it is that everything above `driver-transport.ts` is written against a
 * neutral interface: the schema reads, the monitoring reads and the provider itself
 * would keep working over any other client, and the integration suite already runs
 * them over a session that is not the driver's.
 *
 * So the guard is one assertion with two directions: the driver is imported in
 * `driver-transport.ts`, and nowhere else in the provider. It reads the directory
 * from disk rather than from a list, so it keeps holding as the provider grows.
 *
 * A second rule rides along, and it is the one a reader is most likely to break by
 * accident: nothing above the adapter may name a driver VALUE CLASS. `Long`,
 * `BigDecimal`, `Duration` and `Vector` are the driver's own types, and the neutral
 * result carries their values as strings and arrays precisely so that no consumer has
 * to know them.

 * Cassandra is the engine the whole `supportsResultPagination` design exists for.
 * `supportsExternalQueryLimiting` is `true` here — a bound CAN be injected — and
 * `prepareQuery` still throws on any positive offset, because CQL has no `OFFSET`
 * clause. Reading the old flag as "can be paged" is exactly the mistake that would put
 * a Load More on this provider, so both are asserted together: the two flags disagree,
 * on purpose, and the new one is the one the grid reads.
 *
 * It sits in this file because the issue's Tests section names it. Nothing here scans
 * source text, and the refusal's own message and message-shape coverage stays in
 * `tests/integration/db/cassandra-provider.test.ts`.
