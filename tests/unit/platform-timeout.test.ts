/**
 * Unit tests for tests/helpers/platform-timeout.ts - the Windows-only raise a heavy test

 * The whole point of the helper is the Windows branch, and the machine running this is not
 * Windows, so the platform is injected. The Linux and macOS cases are the paired control:
 * without them every case here would pass just as well for a helper that raised the bound
 * everywhere, which is the thing not wanted.
